### Who Am I

As you can probably tell from the byline, My name is **Shaharyar**, I am studying to become a software engineer.
Currently I am a 16 year old student in Pak-Turk Int'l School in Pakistan. I am in my second year or IGCSE studying **Computer Science** and a self taught programmer.

### What I Do

You can check out my portfolio [here](https://shaharyar-dev.engineer). In short, I Started out in grade 5 making discord bots in javascript as a hobby, I moved to web development, at that time the concept of javascript frameworkds was alien to me. <br/>
I knew i wanted more. When I was around 13, I started looking into machine learning and python. I made a few projects in python, but I was still not satisfied. I wanted to make something that would be used by people. <br/>
This was about the time I came accross the concept of javascript frameworks. I started learning React because it had a better name compared to others. I started making projects.

### My Tech Stack

In React I initially used Vite to create projects before moving on to NextJs. I have always been a fan on tailwind and continue using it. I also have a preference to some UI libraries like NextUI and Shadcn/ui. <span>(This site was built with NextUI)</span> <br/>
So to Sum it up
#### Frontend
- React with NextJs using typescript <span>(app directory)</span>
- TailwindCss
- Shadcn/ui and NextUI

### Backend
- NodeJs or Buntime
- Postgresql with prisma

### Other
- Docker <span>(for local deployment)</span>
- Vercel <span>(for hosting)</span>
- Git and Github <span>for version control</span>

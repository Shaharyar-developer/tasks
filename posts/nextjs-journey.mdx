### Starting Out
While Starting Out, I used vite to create my react applications, I made many apps, like a event promotion app for my school and a business advertisement application for a dairy business.
looking back at those web apps, they were subpar to say the least.
### Moving Forward
Going On I wanted my applications to be more impactful. I decided on learning something more robust. This is when I was introduced to **NextJs.**
I started building with the app directory even though it was experimental at the time and instantly fell in love with it. the idea of server side rendering and the safety they can provide was amazing to me. The **Dynamic Routing**, **Performance** and **Reliability** truly was magical to me. <span>(This opinion on routing was before I knew Nuxt was a thing.)</span>
### Exploring Styling Solutions
At this point in time, I was making and styling all my components manually and it really was a mess. Although I was using tailwindcss, it still felt like something could be improved a lot more, so I started digging and came accross these things called UI libraries, I had heard of them before but never really looked into them.
The first UI library I tried was MUI (material UI) which I believe google uses, It was good, but not good enough, I stopped using it and went back to making my own components, it was at this point that I even made my own components library, (not UI library), I used that for a long time, until Shadcn got announced, It took a similar approach to what I was doing but fixed many of the problems.
### Realization
I realized that shadcn would be the pinnacle of minimal, component based UI libraries, atleast for now. I started using it in all my projects, even electron based ones. I went as far as to make my own themes for it even though there were alot of prebuilt ones.

### Exploring Other Frameworks
After having used NextJs for more than a year now, I wanted to try something new. I had heard of all these new frameworks that would shape the future of web development, Initially I tried out SvelteKit, It felt good initially but I could not understand how it would scale aswell as the security, however the main reason I never fully grasped it was because of how they change javascript in a way that does not feel natural. I then tried out Astro, It is not a framework but close enough, With this, I understood how it could properly scale, however once again, It was not the javascript I knew and loved.

### Conclusion
Although there were other frameworks like vue with Nuxt and others, I never really liked them, not for a particular reason, they just never resonated with me. At the end of day, I am using NextJs, not because I have to but because I like it. I am not saying it's perfect, but for me it is good enough and gets all that I would need to do, done.
